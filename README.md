Break-and-Fix was a group project performed completed during Fullstack Academy. 
The project goal was to utilize three different vulnerability scanners, both commercial and open source and test their accuracy against the metasploitable box. 
As well, we then performed patches on the metasploitable box to update it to a safe standard. 
For systems that could not be patched, we implemented mitigation techniques.
